<p>Most retailers rely on Google Analytics or the publisher reports e.g., Google Ads, FB Ads, or platforms like AdRoll, etc. for understanding how well their ad spend is working.<br><br>Publisher reports are highly biased and give you a narrow view of the performance within a channel, Google Analytics also doesn't provide you the true picture or actionable insights and gives you aggregated data.<br><br>Moreover, with third-party cookies going away and data privacy taking center stage, these platforms will continue to provide narrower insights causing retailers to waste ad spend on channels and audiences that don't convert.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Additionally, over 95% of a retailer's visitors are anonymous and such platforms don't help in understanding such consumers.&nbsp;<br><br>Finding a solution provider to take control of your data is no easy task. Thankfully, our team has surrounded itself with a roster of trusted partners that can help retailers adjust their advertising channel mix to spend money where they get the best return.&nbsp; LayerFive is a third-party analytics tool that is separate from the platform where you are using ad spend. Their philosophy is that this shows the real return on your ad spend, which is potentially different from what publisher tools show. This helps retailers understand if they are wasting their ad dollars on a channel that is not converting if the ad channel reports are showing inflated performance.<br><br>When considering an Analytics Partner or Platform you should also consider their capability to connect to e-commerce platforms e.g. Shopify and other operational and marketing platforms like Klaviyo, Yotpo, Loyalty Lion, and Gorgias for example. Having a 360-degree view of your consumers' behavior will give you a clear direction on business decisions ranging from product investment, like which products to buy more of or less of, marketing investment decisions like sending out SMS versus emails to a certain customer type.</p>
