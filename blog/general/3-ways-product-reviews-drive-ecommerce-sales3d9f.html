          <span><p>What role do product reviews play in your eCommerce business? Nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/online-reviews/" rel="nofollow">95% of customers read online reviews</a>&nbsp;before making a purchase, and displaying reviews can increase conversion rates by 270%.</p> 
<p>So how exactly do reviews drive sales on your site? Here are three ways:</p> 
<p><strong>Reviews provide assurance</strong></p> 
<p>First off, reviews are the assurance that your product isn’t a phony. Reviews come from other customers who are assumed<span class="inline-comment-marker">&nbsp;to be</span>&nbsp;impartial. Lots of positive&nbsp;reviews show that you are a trustworthy business, which in turn makes new customers more inclined to buy your products.</p> 
<p>Reviews are user-generated content (UGC) and come directly from consumers, rather than brands themselves. They are raw, unfiltered, and most of all, real. Since these reviews are unconstrained, customers may feel as if they are personal recommendations. In fact, 78% of buyers trust reviews as much as a personal recommendation.</p> 
<p>If you sell only on your eCommerce site and not in-store, reviews are assurance that your product is legit. We all hate the feeling of opening a package after waiting a few business days, only to realize the product wasn’t exactly the same as it was online. Reviews assure future cust<span class="inline-comment-marker">omers that</span>&nbsp;this is not the case, giving shoppers the confidence to make a purchase.</p> 
<p>Reviews are also social proof you can use to your advantage. If many people are loving your products, others will wonder what the hype is about and be more likely to purchase.</p> 
<p><strong>Reviews show your business cares</strong></p> 
<p>Negative reviews are inevitable. Not everyone is going to love your product. Or maybe there was a mistake that backfired, and now your customer is unhappy. But this is not something to fear; it is something to embrace. Believe it or not, studies show that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irevere.com/general/why-you-need-negative-reviews/" rel="nofollow">negative reviews make products seem&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;valid</a>&nbsp;to customers!</p> 
<p>Negative reviews give you a chance to show your outstanding customer service. Reply to the review.&nbsp;This is an opportunity to demonstrate that you care about the satisfaction of your customers. The way you handle customer frustrations can actually improve brand loyalty, because you went out of your way to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irevere.com/general/closing-the-customer-feedback-loop/" rel="nofollow">close the feedback loop</a>.</p> 
<p>Bad reviews also give you room to improve. If many customers are having the same thoughts, maybe it’s time to reassess that product. If you can address the issues with the product and update your unhappy customers, more people may decide to buy from you in the future.</p> 
<p><strong>Reviews help small businesses grow</strong></p> 
<p>Reviews give small businesses (or SME) credibility. They are a great indicator to let new customers know you have great service and dependable products. Even just a handful of positive reviews can make a difference. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/online-reviews/" rel="nofollow">Spiegel Research Center</a>, having five reviews results in purchase likelihood increasing by a factor of almost four times. That's huge! Start sending out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irevere.com/general/crafting-the-perfect-post-purchase-email/" rel="nofollow">post-purchase emails</a>&nbsp;requesting reviews to your existing customers now, and you will be off to a great start.</p> 
<p>Reviews can also help SMEs by enhancing&nbsp;<span class="inline-comment-marker">SEO</span>, driving more organic site traffic. Reviews act like mini blogs on your site made to answer questions for other shoppers. This will get your brand into the hands of new consumers.</p>
