          <span><p><span>Increasing that stubborn </span><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate"><span>2-3% eCommerce conversion rate </span></a><span>is extremely important to today’s marketers and ecommerce teams – and for good reason. By optimizing your conversion rate, you can increase revenue per visitor, acquire more customers, and grow your business.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Despite its importance, many eCommerce sites still lack some personalization functionality that is proven to nudge conversion rates in the right direction (Psst. If you’re still not convinced about needing to prioritize personalization, </span><a href="https://get4tell.com/4-reasons-prioritize-personalization/"><span>check out this blog.</span></a><span>)</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>With that said, consider implementing these 4 not-so-obvious personalization features to fuel conversion.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><b>1. Personalized Category Landing Pages</b></p> 
<p><span>Unlike product recommendation blocks that have a designated place on product pages and are clearly marked with something like ‘You May Also Like’, personalized category pages operate incognito.</span></p> 
<p><span>To the shopper, they see a traditional category landing page with blocks of category options to choose from. Little do they know, the order in which those blocks appear have been personalized based on their real-time behavior, history, and preferences.</span></p> 
<p><span>For example, if a customer frequently purchased and viewed dresses, skirts, and shoes, those 3 categories would appear first or higher than the other categories on the category landing page.</span><span><br> </span><span>For eCommerce websites that have 1,000+ products, utilizing personalization in this way ensures that every shopper can quickly find the right items in the categories they care about most. Ultimately, this expedites their path to purchase and increases the chance of conversion.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><b>2. Personalized Search</b></p> 
<p><span>Personalized search is the quickest way to drive conversion. Shoppers who search for products already have a high intent to purchase. Accelerating that process by using </span><a href="https://get4tell.com/smart-commerce-platform/personalization-3/"><span>smart search</span></a><span> to autofill keywords and show relevant and personalized recommendations based on real-time behavior and historical data, will only fuel the chances of conversion that much more.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Within seconds, a predictive site search experience allows shoppers to quickly refine their search and efficiently find items that are aligned with their immediate interests—and all without navigating away from the search bar.</span></p> 
<p><span>Infusing personalization deeper through smart search will increase product discovery, conversion, and AOV.</span><span><br> </span><b><br> </b><b>3. Personalized Content</b></p> 
<p><span>The importance content plays in the shopper journey often depends on the company and industry—for example, shoppers of manufacturing companies often require content to move through the funnel, especially when it’s a high consideration purchase. By educating shoppers on specific product features or adding some inspiration around their offering, shoppers are more likely to engage and convert. </span></p> 
<p><span>But for content to be impactful, it must be relevant and timely to customer’s real-time needs—that’s where content recommendations come in. Just like product recommendations, content can be served up to shoppers based on their history, real-time behavior, and preferences. </span></p> 
<p><span>Here’s an example of how Bob’s Red Mill, one of the largest producers of natural food products, deployed content recommendations: when a shopper types ‘bread’ in the search bar, they receive search results for blogs about bread, bread recipes, and ingredients that are relevant when making bread.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>With an experience that is this responsive and accommodating to shoppers’ individual behavior, consumers are more likely to engage with content that is relevant to their needs and ultimately convert.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><b>4. Strategically placed recommendations from Google Advertisements</b></p> 
<p><span>If you’re a marketer, you are all too familiar with the cost of digital advertising. You pay a lot to drive new customers to your site. And you’re likely always looking for ways to get more out of that investment by turning new shoppers into paying customers.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>GiftTree, the leading gifting company in the U.S., struggled with this same pain point. Specifically, they noticed that the product(s) displayed on their digital advertisement was often not the product that customers driven from the ads ended up purchasing.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>To combat this problem, GiftTree places recommendation blocks above the product on the product display page (PDP). This way, if the product in the ad wasn’t quite what browsers were looking for, new customers could easily view and find other products that are similar to the one they previously selected in the advertisement.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Simply by moving the product recommendation block from the bottom of the page to the top, GiftTree significantly increased conversion (compared to traditional PDP pages) for those who came to GiftTree from a digital advertisement.</span><span><br> </span><span>Implementing these not-so-known personalization features are key in driving optimal conversion and deep customer loyalty with your website visitors.</span></p>
