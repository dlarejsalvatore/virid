          <span><p>When creating a marketing campaign that has touchpoints across multiple channels, it's important to first understand the&nbsp;<u><a href="https://compu-mail.com/omnichannel-vs-multichannel-webinar-recording/">difference between multi-channel and omnichannel marketing</a></u>. While multi-channel involves attracting customers across as many channels as possible, omnichannel involves integrating multiple channels to engage customers in a holistic way.&nbsp;A buyer's journey can start anywhere at anytime, and an omnichannel strategy allows you to meet your customers where they are already seeking out&nbsp;brands—social media, in brick-and-mortar stores, on marketplaces, and more. Here's what to keep in mind when it comes to creating an omnichannel campaign:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>For an omnichannel campaign to be successful, you need to align your PR, customer success, marketing, and sales teams. Ensure that they know your campaign messaging, as well as which channels you are targeting. This will help you tell a unified story across channels and maintain one cohesive brand experience.</li> 
 <li>Remember that an omnichannel campaign should <strong>eliminate effort from the customer experience</strong>. Customers should be able to shop seamlessly across multiple channels, and your marketing campaign should span multiple channels just as easily. For example, geo-targeting mobile ads when a customer is near a brick-and-mortar store, or including a promo code in your store catalog to allow customers to save online. These are both great ways to connect with consumers in more than one place, and allows for more opportunities to make a sale.</li> 
 <li>Utilize local advertising strategies. <strong><a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101/seo-statistics/">93% of online experiences</a>&nbsp;begin with a search engine</strong>—optimize your Google My Business profile if you haven't already done so. Make sure you are constantly refining your local search strategy. If your eCommerce site offers Buy Online Pickup in Store, utilize local inventory ads, and utilize regional targeting on social media. Engaging your local customer base online can improve digital and brick-and-mortar sales.</li> 
 <li>If you are selling on marketplaces, make sure you are optimizing your product pages on those channels as well. For example,&nbsp;<u><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/09/11/amazon-advertising">follow best practices for selling on Amazon</a></u>, and use their advertising platform to engage consumers that are already shopping on marketplaces.</li> 
 <li>Don't neglect <strong>social media marketing</strong>. For retail brands, this can be one of the most effective forms of advertising. Partner with influencers on seasonal campaigns, make your social posts shoppable, and use re-targeting on social media after a customer has visited your site. Your customers&nbsp;likely already use&nbsp;social media on a regular basis, so use that platform to engage them with your brand.</li> 
 <li>Make the most of direct mail. With the constant stream of information from online sources, sometimes <strong>taking your marketing efforts offline</strong> can be the most effective strategy. Send customers a coupon code to use in stores or online in the mail, add handwritten thank you notes to outgoing packages, or send out cards or mailers around different holidays. Sometimes this break from the ordinary advertising channels can be just the thing that helps your brand stand apart from the rest.</li>
