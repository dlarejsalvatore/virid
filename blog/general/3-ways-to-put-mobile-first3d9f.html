          <span><p>In the age of digital transformation, technology is quickly evolving, and consumer behavior is changing just as rapidly. Customers are no longer shopping exclusively in malls, nor are they shopping solely on their desktops. Instead, customers are shopping in-store, on their laptops, and on their phones, sometimes using more than one device at once. Being mobile-first means crafting your eCommerce strategy beginning from the smallest screen and working your way up, designing the user experience for usability and convenience at a customer's fingertips.</p> 
<p><span class="inline-comment-marker">Below,</span> we've outlined 3 best practices for implementing a <span class="inline-comment-marker">mobile-first</span> strategy in your eCommerce business:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li><strong>Optimize your site for mobile.&nbsp;</strong>This one sounds obvious, but it is the crux of a <span class="inline-comment-marker">mobile-first</span> philosophy. Optimizing for mobile means more than just making images responsive on smaller devices. There are nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/276819/number-of-mobile-shoppers-in-the-united-states/">200 million mobile shoppers</a> in the US. Reach customers where they are by ensuring customers can access the information they need anywhere, even <span class="inline-comment-marker">in-store</span> on a mobile device. Make sure product ratings and reviews are visible on mobile, as 82% of shoppers <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2268444/google-mobile-search-helps-82-of-instore-shoppers-make-purchase-decisions-study">consult their phones</a> on purchases they are going to make while&nbsp;<span class="inline-comment-marker">in-store</span>. Additionally, allowing for mobile payment options&nbsp;<span class="inline-comment-marker">like <a href="../../general/the-next-generation-of-cashless-payment-apple-pay/index.html">Apple Pay</a>&nbsp;</span>on your site creates a more seamless experience for your shoppers, and ultimately increases repeat purchases and brand loyalty. Finally, consider if your site passes the "<a href="https://www.practicalecommerce.com/mobile-site-pass-thumb-zone-test">thumb zone test</a>,<span class="inline-comment-marker">" o</span>r if users have to put more effort into navigating<span class="inline-comment-marker">&nbsp;your sit</span>e than they want to. All of these are factors of mobile optimization and can mean the difference between a positive or negative customer experience.</li> 
 <li><strong>I<span class="inline-comment-marker">ncorporate mobile into your marketing strategy.</span>&nbsp;</strong>Research shows that&nbsp;77% of consumers want to receive their <a href="https://marketingland.com/77-percent-of-us-want-to-get-marketing-messages-via-email-theres-no-close-second-place-study-says-9420">marketing messages via email</a>, yet the majority of marketing emails go <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/email-marketing/email-communications-strategy/statistics-sources-for-email-marketing/">unopened</a>. Email messages need to be optimized just as webpages do. In fact, desktop only represents 17% of all email opens, whereas <a href="https://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics/">mobile accounts for 47%</a>&nbsp;of all opens. In addition to optimizing your email marketing, another way to better engage your customers is through text message marketing. SMS is the latest frontier of mobile marketing. 98% of<a href="https://www.marketingprofs.com/chirp/2017/32612/sms-is-on-the-rise-for-business-trends-and-stats-infographic"> text messages</a> sent are read, and nearly 8 out of 10 businesses believe customers prefer SMS/text support. Email inboxes are flooded with irrelevant marketing content everyday, but texts from brands are still a relatively new concept. Connect with customers through loyalty programs, alerts about new promotions, or even status updates on online orders, all through text.</li> 
 <li><strong>Consider creating a mobile app.&nbsp;</strong>Research has shown that 72% of consumers think that <a href="https://aytm.com/blog/daily-survey-results/retail-mobile-apps-survey/">mobile apps make shopping easier</a>, and 46% said they are actually more likely to shop using mobile apps than they are to <span class="inline-comment-marker">shop through a website</span>. Despite many retailers focusing more efforts on mobile commerce, <span class="inline-comment-marker">consumers still have a lingering concern</span> that sites will be slow to load or awkward to use on their phones. Additionally, many websites are not built mobile-first and are missing sections or functions of the full website. This could explain the preference towards shopping on apps. Keep in mind that building a mobile app is extremely resource intensive, and the app should add significant value to the shopping experience in a way that your mobile site does not. Engage and delight customers on a mobile app with exclusive promotions, loyalty programs, and easy order management to make the investment worthwhile.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Embracing the <span class="inline-comment-marker">mobile-first</span> philosophy is quickly becoming mandatory for retailers.
