<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2018 is the year of the customer experience. All retailers want <span class="inline-comment-marker">to <strong>increase sales</strong></span>, and to do this, you will need to shift your focus from individual customer touchpoints to improving the end-to-end customer journey.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the following principles to improve your customer experience:</p>
<h3><strong>Make it omnichannel.</strong></h3>
<p>You can't control how customers get to your site, but you can make certain that there are several paths available and that customers&nbsp;have a <strong>cohesive brand experience</strong> no matter <span class="inline-comment-marker">which path they choose</span>. Place timely content <strong>where your demographic spends time</strong> online or in real life, and segment your audience to reach customers with the content most relevant to&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Because the customer experience spans multiple channels, it is also crucial for retailers to emphasize <strong>customer satisfaction at each touchpoint</strong>. The customer may be satisfied with the social media post alerting them of a sale or the answer they received from customer service on a particular question, but that does not guarantee overall satisfaction throughout their journey to checkout. Maybe the product detail page for the item they wanted took too long to load, or a customer service representative did not get back to them for two days, or the navigation of the site was confusing. All of these elements add to the <strong>customer’s perception of the brand</strong>.&nbsp;Whether customers are shopping online, through a catalog, or in a brick-and-mortar store, they perceive each channel as part of one brand experience, and they<strong> expect this experience to be frictionless</strong>, making it crucial, for example, for your back-end systems to be integrated seamlessly with your online storefront, or for your catalog to be shoppable on your site.</p>
<h3><strong>Make it personalized.</strong></h3>
<p>Now more than ever, customers are demanding unique, personalized shopping experiences in exchange for their brand loyalty. This principle of personalization goes beyond allowing customers to customize their own&nbsp;products–it means allowing them to <strong><span class="inline-comment-marker">control</span> their own shopping experience</strong>. Optimizing your site for mobile, providing relevant cross-sells, and even implementing loyalty programs can all contribute to a more personalized customer experience.</p>
<p>Suggest <span class="inline-comment-marker">timely</span> content for the customer through curated cross-sells specific to the items in their cart. <span>Let the customer manage their own shopping experience by offering a variety of&nbsp;</span><strong>unique product filters</strong><span>, beyond price and color. For example, would your customers prefer to shop using&nbsp;</span><span>attributes&nbsp;like skirt length, heel height, or fabric?</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, when implementing any type of personalization, it's important to be aware of your customer's privacy concerns and be transparent about the data collected.</span>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<strong>customer loyalty program</strong> that rewards repeat shoppers with points and special deals can help retailers gain consumer insights while giving those customers visibility into what information is being used.</p>
<h3><strong>Make it valuable.</strong></h3>
<p>At every step in their shopping experience, customers expect additional value. The customer experience should involve a <strong>constant exchange</strong> between retailer and customer, whether that comes in the form of a coupon in their inbox when they sign up for emails or a loyalty reward if they leave a product review. Additionally, providing customers with a low-friction checkout and hassle-free return policy can <strong>save time and frustration</strong> throughout their journey.</p>
<p>Ensuring a positive customer experience is an investment. It involves taking a step back and considering your customers' experience holistically, and it requires commitment from all team members. However, given the benefits–customer loyalty, reduced churn, increased revenue, and higher employee satisfaction–it's a worthwhile investment.</p>
